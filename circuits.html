            <p>
            In my third college semester, I had no software engineering courses. To avoid losing any skill, I gave myself a project to work on over those 15 weeks. My goal was to make a digital circuits simulator that was based on what I was learning in the computer engineering course I was taking.
            <br><br>
            My main goal was to gain a deeper appreciation for the ui that I use on a day-to-day basis; creating an interactive system that works well is difficult. I learned that there is much more to a good ui than just making it responsive: it needs to be intuitive for new users, reward those more fluent in the system with a quicker workflow, and it needs to have all of the features easily accessible.
            <br><br>
            I also learned a little bit about how to use colors to my advantage. More specifically, I learned what colors to apply to an element to best represent its functionality. On a somewhat related note, I got to work with skeuomorphism with the number displays which was a lot of fun.
            <br><br>
            When I have more time, I would like to return to the project to both refine it and add more features. One thing I would like to do is refactor the code to take advantage of inheritence which I did not know how to properly leverage at the time of development. Additionally, I am aware of some bugs with the ui which need to be patched when I get the time.
            <br><br>
            While I can acknowledge where this project has room for improvement, I am very proud of what I was able to make in just 15 weeks. Please use the download button to try the software for yourself (it is only available for desktop use and may require a Java installation), or follow the Github link to check out the repository.
