            <p id="intro"><tab-in></tab-in>Munchkin brings you the essence of the dungeon-crawling experience
            . . . without all that messy roleplaying!
            This game includes 168 cards, one six-sided die, and these rules. Three to
            six can play. You will need 10 tokens (coins, poker chips, whatever – or any
            gadget that counts to 10) for each player</p>
            <h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>Divide the cards into the Door deck and the Treasure deck. Shuffle both
            decks. Deal four cards from each deck to each player.</p>
            <h1>Card Management</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>Keep separate face-up discard piles for the two decks. You may not look
            through the discards unless you play a card that allows you to! When a deck
            runs out, reshuffle its discards.
            <br>
            <b><tab-in></tab-in>In Play:</b> These are the cards on the table in front of you, showing your
            Race and Class (if any) and the Items you are carrying. Continuing Curses
            and some other cards also stay on the table after you play them. Cards in play
            are public information and must be visible to the other players.</p>
            <div class="special">
                <h1 id="conflicts">Conflicts Between Cards and Rules</h1>
                <p><tab-in></tab-in>This rulesheet gives the general rules. Many cards add special rules,
                so in most cases when the rulesheet disagrees with a card, follow the
                card. However, ignore any card effect that might seem to contradict one
                of the rules listed below unless the card explicitly says it supersedes
                that rule!
                <br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Nothing can reduce a player below Level 1, although card effects
                might reduce a player’s or a monster’s combat strength <a href="#combat">(p. 3)</a> below 1.</li>
                    <li>You go up a level after combat only if you kill a monster.</li>
                    <li>You cannot collect rewards for defeating a monster (e.g., Treasure,
                levels) in the middle of a combat. You must finish the fight before
                gaining any rewards.</li>
                    <li>You must kill a monster to reach Level 10, and you cannot force
                another player to help you do it.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <tab-in></tab-in>Any other disputes should be settled by loud arguments, with the
                owner of the game having the last word. You could also read the
                Munchkin FAQ and errata pages at munchkin.game, or start a
                discussion at forums.sjgames.com/munchkin . . . unless it’s more
                fun to argue.</p>
            </div>
            <p><b><tab-in></tab-in>Your Hand:</b> Cards in your hand are not in play. They don’t help you, but
            they can’t be taken away except by cards that specifically affect “your hand.”
            At the end of your turn, you may have no more than five cards in your hand
            (see Charity, p. 2).
            Cards in play may not be returned to your hand – they must be discarded
            or traded if you want to get rid of them.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 id="turnPhases">Turn Phases</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>Your turn begins as soon as the previous player’s turn ends. When your cards are arranged the way you want, go to phase 1.
            <br><br>
            <b>(1) Kick Open The Door</b>: Draw one card from the Door deck and turn it face up. If it’s a monster, you must fight it. See Combat, p. 3. If the card is a curse – see Curses, p. 5 – it applies to you immediately (if it can) and is discarded (unless it has a persistent effect you keep the card as a reminder of an upcoming effect). If you draw any other card, you may either put it in your hand or play it immediately.
            <br><br>
            <b>(2) Look For Trouble/Loot The Room</b>: If you fought a monster in phase 1, skip this phase and go to phase 3. If you did NOT draw a monster when you first opened the door, you have two choices: either Look For Trouble or Loot The Room.
            <br><br>
            <b>Look For Trouble</b>: Play a monster from your hand and fight it, just as if you had found it when you kicked open the door. Don’t play a monster you can’t handle, unless you’re sure you can count on getting help (see p. 4)!
            <br>
            <b>Loot The Room</b>: Draw a second card from the Door deck, face down,
            and place it in your hand.
            <br><br>
            <b>(3) Charity</b>: If you have more than five cards in your hand, you must play
            enough cards to get you to five or below – for instance, you can play Curses,
            sell Items from your hand, or play Items to the table. If you cannot reduce
            your hand to five cards, or do not want to, you must give the excess cards to
            the player with the lowest Level. If players are tied for lowest, divide the cards
            as evenly as possible, but it’s up to you who gets the bigger set(s) of leftovers.
            If YOU are the lowest or tied for lowest, just discard the excess.
            As soon as you are finished with Charity, the next player’s turn begins.</p>
            <br>
            <h1 id="treasures">Treasures</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>Treasure cards include permanent and “one-shot” cards. Any
            Treasure card may be played to the table as soon as you get it, or at
            any time on your own turn except during combat (unless the rules
            below or the card itself says otherwise).</p>
            <br>
            <h1 id="items">Items</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>Most Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is
            equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>All Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually
            giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not
            equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your
            Items during a combat or while running away.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>
            Anyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you
            may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and
            two “1 Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that
            lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of
            the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance,
            you can equip only one of them at a time.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>
            Likewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of
            Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for
            someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>
            You cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a
            level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who
            wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race
            abilities. And a Curse or a monster’s Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to
            get rid of something!
            <br><br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>
            <b>Big Items:</b> You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big
            one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard
            one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a
            Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.
            If something lets you have more than one Big item (for instance, the
            Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either correct the problem
            immediately or get rid of all but one Big item. If it’s your turn and you’re
            not in combat, you can sell the excess Big items (as long as you have at least
            1,000 Gold Pieces of Items to sell). Otherwise, you must give them to the
            lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over,
            discard them.
            <br><br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>
            <b>Trading:</b> You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players.
            You may only trade Items from the table – not from your hand. You
            may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in
            combat – in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn. Any
            Item you receive in a trade must remain in play.
            You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players –
            “I’ll give you my Flaming Armor if you won’t help Bob fight that dragon!”
            You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you.
            <br><br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>
            <b>Selling Items for Levels:</b> At any point during your turn except
            during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of
            at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value”
            cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance)
            1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don’t get change. But if you can
            manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so
            on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are
            carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>To fight a monster, compare its combat strength to yours. Combat
            strength is the total of Level plus all modifiers – positive or negative –
            given by Items and other cards. If the monster’s combat strength is
            equal to yours, or greater, you lose the combat and must Run
            Away (see p. 5). If your combat strength totals more than the
            monster’s – note that monsters win ties! – you kill it and go up a
            level (two levels for some big monsters). You’ll also get the number
            of Treasures shown on its card.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>Sometimes a card will let you get rid of the monster without
            killing it. This is still “winning,” but you don’t get a level. Unless
            the ability says otherwise, you don’t get the Treasures, either. If the
            last monster is removed from a combat, it ends instantly.
            Some monster cards have special powers that affect combat
            – a bonus against a Race or Class, for instance. Be sure to
            check these!
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>You and the other players may play one-shot Treasures or use Class or
            Race abilities to help or harm you in your combat. Some Door cards may
            also be played into a combat, such as monster enhancers (see below).
            If you kill a monster (or monsters!), discard the monster(s) and any other
            cards played, and claim your rewards. But note: someone may play a hostile
            card on you, or use a special power, just as you think you have won. When you
            kill a monster, you must wait a reasonable time, defined as about 2.6 seconds,
            for anyone else to speak up. After that, you have really killed the monster, and
            you really get the level(s) and Treasures, though they can still whine and argue.</p>

                <p>When you fight a monster, you compare your combat strength
                (your Level plus any bonuses or penalties) against the monster’s
                combat strength. If your combat strength is greater, you win! If it is
                tied or lower, the monster wins.

                For the full explanation, see <a href="#combat">Combat, p. 3</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <h1 id="characterStats">Character Stats</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>Each character is basically a collection of weapons, armor, and magic items,
            with three stats: Level, Race, and Class. For instance, you might describe
            your character as a “Level 8 Elf Wizard with Boots of Butt-Kicking,
            a Staff of Napalm, and the Kneepads of Allure.”
            <br>
            <b><tab-in></tab-in>Level:</b> This is a measure of how generally buff and studly you are. When
            the rules or cards refer to your Level, capitalized, they mean this number.
            You gain a level when you kill a monster, or when a card says that you do.
            You can also sell Items to buy levels <a href="#items">(see Items)</a>.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>You lose a level when a card says you do. Your Level can
            never go below 1. However, your combat strength can be
            negative, if you get hit by a Curse or suffer some other
            kind of penalty.
            <br><br>
            <b><tab-in></tab-in>Class:</b> Characters may be Warriors, Wizards, Thieves, or
            Clerics. If you have no Class card in front of you, you have no class.
            Yeah, I know, we did that one already.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>Each Class has special abilities, shown on the cards. You gain the
            abilities of a Class the moment you play its card in front of you, and
            lose them as soon as you discard that card. Some Class abilities are
            powered by discards. You may discard any card, in play or in your
            hand, to power a special ability.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>See the Class cards for when abilities can be used. Note
            that a Thief cannot steal while he or the target is fighting –
            and as soon as a monster is revealed, the fight is on!
            You can discard a Class card at any time, even in
            combat: “I don’t wanna be a wizard anymore.” When you discard a Class
            card, you become classless until you play another Class card.
            You may not belong to more than one class at once unless you play the
            Super Munchkin card.
            <br><br>
            <b><tab-in></tab-in>Race:</b> Characters may be Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Halflings. If you
            have no Race card in front of you, you are human.
            <br>
            Humans have no special abilities. The rules for Classes, above, also apply
            to Races.
            <br>
            You may not belong to more than one race at once
            unless you play the Half-Breed card.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1 class="superMunchkinAndHalfBreed">Super Munchkin and Half-Breed</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>These cards may be played whenever
            it is legal to play a Class or Race, as
            long as you have an appropriate card
            (Class for Super Munchkin, Race for
            Half-Breed) to attach it to. You cannot have more than one of the same
            Class or Race card in play at once.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>If you play Super Munchkin with one Class, you get all the advantages
            of being that Class (the ability to equip Class-only Items, monsters with
            penalties against that Class suffer those penalties) and none of the
            disadvantages (you can equip Items forbidden to that Class, and
            monsters do not get bonuses because of your Class). If the Class
            has an ability that has a cost, however, you must still pay it – you
            aren’t that Super! If you play Super Munchkin while you have two
            Classes, you have all the normal advantages and disadvantages of both
            Classes. (All of the above is also true for Half-Breed, just for Races.)</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Treasures</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>Treasure cards include permanent and “one-shot” cards. Any
            Treasure card may be played to the table as soon as you get it, or at
            any time on your own turn except during combat (unless the rules
            below or the card itself says otherwise).</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1 id="items">Items</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>Most Treasures are Items. Items have a Gold Piece value. “No Value” is
            equivalent to zero Gold Pieces, and a “No Value” card is considered an Item.
            All Items you have in play are considered “carried.” Items that are actually
            giving you a bonus are “equipped.” You should indicate Items that are not
            equipped by turning the cards sideways. You may not alter the status of your
            Items during a combat or while running away.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>Anyone can carry any Item (except for extra Big items; see below), but you
            may equip only one Headgear, one suit of Armor, one pair of Footgear, and
            two “1 Hand” Items (or one “2 Hands” Item) . . . unless you have a card that
            lets you ignore these limits, such as Hireling or Cheat!, or unless one of
            the cards says otherwise. If you are carrying two Headgear cards, for instance,
            you can equip only one of them at a time.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>Likewise, some Items have restrictions: for instance, the Mace of
            Sharpness can only be wielded by a Cleric. Its bonus only counts for
            someone who is, at the moment, a Cleric.
            You cannot discard Item cards “just because.” You may sell Items for a
            level, trade Items with other players, or give an Item to another player who
            wants it (see below). You may discard Items to power certain Class and Race
            abilities. And a Curse or a monster’s Bad Stuff (see p. 5) may force you to
            get rid of something!
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in><b>Big Items:</b> You may carry any number of Small items, but only one Big
            one. (Any item not marked Big is considered Small.) You may not discard
            one Big item to play another; you must sell the first Item, trade it, lose it to a
            Curse or Bad Stuff, or discard it to power a Class or Race ability.
            If something lets you have more than one Big item (for instance, the
            Dwarf race) and you lose that ability, you must either correct the problem
            immediately or get rid of all but one Big item. If it’s your turn and you’re
            not in combat, you can sell the excess Big items (as long as you have at least 
            1,000 Gold Pieces of Items to sell). Otherwise, you must give them to the
            lowest-Level player(s) who can carry them! If any Big items are still left over,
            discard them.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in><b>Trading:</b> You may trade Items (but no other cards) with other players.
            You may only trade Items from the table – not from your hand. You
            may trade at any time except when you or your trading partner are in
            combat – in fact, the best time to trade is when it’s not your turn. Any
            Item you receive in a trade must remain in play.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>You may also give Items away without a trade, to bribe other players –
            “I’ll give you my Flaming Armor if you won’t help Bob fight that dragon!”
            You may show your hand to others. Like we could stop you.
            Selling Items for Levels: At any point during your turn except
            during combat or Running Away, you may discard Items worth a total of
            at least 1,000 Gold Pieces and immediately go up one level. (“No Value”
            cards are the same as zero Gold Pieces.) If you discard (for instance)
            1,100 Gold Pieces worth, you don’t get change. But if you can
            manage 2,000 worth, you can go up two levels at once, and so
            on. You may sell Items from your hand as well as those you are
            carrying. You may not sell Items to go to Level 10.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>“One-Shot” Treasures</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>A Treasure card that says “Usable once only” is often called a “one-shot”
            Treasure. Most of these are used during combat to strengthen the munchkins
            or the monsters, and may be played from your hand or from the table. Some
            have other effects, however, so read the card carefully! Discard these cards as
            soon as the combat is over or their effect is resolved.
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>One-shot Items with a Gold Piece value may be sold for levels, just like
            other Items.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h1>Other Treasures</h1>
            <p><tab-in></tab-in>Other Treasure cards (like Go Up a Level cards) are not Items. Most of
            these cards say when they can be played, and whether they stay in play or are
            discarded. A couple of specific examples:
            <br>
            <tab-in></tab-in>Go Up a Level cards may be played on yourself or any other player at any
            time, even during combat. Discard them once they are played. Exception:
            You cannot play a Go Up a Level card to give a player the winning level!
            Hireling may be played at any time, on any turn. You cannot give a
            Hireling an Item to carry while you are in combat, however.</p>
